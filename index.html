                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripting languange. It a small and lightweight
                    languange. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to
                    the objects of its envirenment to provide programatic control over them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript contains standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    languange elements such as operators, control structers,and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purpose by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core languange by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its Document Object Model(DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
                        place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and
                        page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extands the core languange by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                        with database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                        application, or perform file manipulation on server.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript languange resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs
                    which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object
                    model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritace; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also support functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
