                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripting languange. It a small and lightweight
                    languange. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to
                    the objects of its envirenment to provide programatic control over them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript contains standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    languange elements such as operators, control structers,and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purpose by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core languange by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its Document Object Model(DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
                        place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and
                        page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extands the core languange by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                        with database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                        application, or perform file manipulation on server.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript languange resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs
                    which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object
                    model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritace; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also support functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form languange compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                    classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protecte, and you do not have to impelement intefaces. Variables, parameters, and function return
                    types are not explicitly typed.

                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                JavaScript code:
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) {alert("Hello " + yourName); } greetMe("World");
                </code>

                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of varibels, called
                identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                A JavScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and characterws "a" through z (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as ā and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode
                escape sequences as character in indetifier. Some example of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                _name.

            <article>
                You can declare a varible in three ways:
                <p>
                    With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax can be used to declare both
                    local and global varibles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global
                    varible. It generates a strict JavaScript warnig. You shouldn't use this variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword let. For example,<code>let y = 13</code> This syntax can be used to declare a block
                    scope local variable. See variable scope below.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>

            <article>
                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                    global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                    current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
                    called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                    function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
                    rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
                    global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
                    code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
                    context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
                    is an if statement.
                </p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                <p>
                    This behavior changes, when using the let declaration inroduced in ECMAScript 2015.
                </p>

                <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                    defined</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Global_varibles">

            <article>
                <p>
                    Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                    pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
                    variables using the window.variable syntax.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
                    frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame
                    name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
                    document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
                    parent.phoneNumber.
                </p>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
                    syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                    identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
                    can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                </p>

                <code>const PI = 3,14;</code>
                <p>
                    A constant cannot change the value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running.
                    It has to be initialized to a value.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const
                    keyword is omitted, the indetifier is assimed to represent a variable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For
                    example:
                </p>

                <code>/ THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                    CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                    }</code>
                However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
                <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>
